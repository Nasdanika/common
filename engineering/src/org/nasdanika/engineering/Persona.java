 * Description from internet, e.g. Wikipedia. Abstraction of parties who benefit from organization offerings. Not necessarily pay for them or use them. Weight - manual or computed with decision analysis. Manual may be sales volume, budget contribution for internal customers, population, percentage in profit generation. E.g. a grant size is dependent on how many personas adopt a product. References parties are persona representatives. Such parties may be involved in need identification and prioritization. Defined at EngineeringOrgUnit level - may be internal personas and internal products. May have base personas and personas can be organized into a hierarchy. Base personas define common needs, what everybody needs. Base personas may be abstract - no representatives and no own weight.
