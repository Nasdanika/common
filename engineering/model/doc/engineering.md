A model of engineering - a process of building something composite by resolving issues associated with solution components by engineers in increments and making the new functionality available in releases.

Reasoning - as-code, lives with the code and models, references other models, no server - can be private on an encrypted flash drive in a safe. End-to-end - New product, small team.

Many issues. Align with strategic objectives and customer needs to maximize value - customer benefit per expenditure - cost and effort.

Create something in a number of steps by one or more participants - engineers - for the benefit of customers - personas.

Engineering practice - a large model, don't have to consume all at once, expand to new modeling elements as needed. 
Also not everything explained here is currently available - some sections document intent, which will be captures as product features once initial functionality is achieved.

### Core concepts

Engineered element, release, increment, issue - dependencies, benefit/effective, engineer - role. Time, cost. Availability, budget.
categories - also values.

Plan the work and work the plan. Feel good about what you and your organization are doing and not doing, i.e. that what your are doing is more important than what you are not doing an there is a quantified justification for that,
not just a guess.

### Organization engineering

Units, roles, processes (rigel later). 

Single person - still an organization and a role. Reasons:
* Model clarity
* Evolution/growth - new roles may be added, transition to another person.

### Strategic planning

Objectives, key results. Increments.

### Persona engineering

Persona benefits from engineering organization outputs (offerings). Not necessarily buys or uses.
Persona is an engineered element - owner, issues, ... representatives

Resources reference and palette - markdown docs, rigel flows, ... - party level. Embedded and references. Folders


Rigel activities defined in roles (actor). Prof extensions report which flows role participates in.

Needs, scenarios, offerings

Customer value and strategic value/alignment - objectives.

Price justification, negotiation using benefits delivered by offerings.

### Product/offering engineering

### Planning

Strategic alignment, value (benefit/cost), proportional allocation to personas, categories, objectives.

Capacity management - plan/schedule/execute. Issues and features are work plans with different quality attributes - benefit, cost, in the future risk and requirements.

* Planning - creation of features and issues and elaboration to the level that they are detailed enough for execution.
* Scheduling - selection of features and issues to work on to:
  * maximize value, 
  * optimize load on the organization - not over capacity, but not idling either, 
  * other quality attributes, e.g. balancing customer needs, development buckets (categories), risk.


### Decision analysis

Manual, [MCDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-criteria_decision_analysis) later - [AHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process), [WSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_sum_model), and 
[WPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_product_model).



### Risk management

To be added later. One option is to have "expectancy" or "confidence level" on issues. Another is to have some model of risks: Risk, probability (e.g. high, medium, low), impact (high, medium, low), affects - schedule, cost, show-stopper.

### Capability management

Capability, Capability provider, requirement. Skill, time, money. Binary, numeric, cumulative. Describe concepts, implement later. Planning in terms of capabilities and requirements.
Time and money are built-in capabilities. Issues - requirement, aAvailability and budget - providers.

### Notes

personal planning - interests are, say, categories. Life balance.
Example/idea - write a book with Vinci - target audiences, chapters, issues, releases.

Increments - nested, criteria, issue planned for, engineer availability, budgets

Release - owned by engineered element, date, issues assigned, includes other releases of other engineered elements.

Engineering model of Nasdanika including personas

Engineering model for cross-functional semi-formal teams/organizations - tiger teams (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_team).

Communicate intent/ideas, seek/justify funding - a form of a business plan.

Nasdanika personas:

* Enthusiast - does it for themselves. Uses to put a structure around efforts.
* Innovator - uses, shares ideas, seeks feedback, justifies funding, drives execution
    * IT innovator - also extends

Template(s) with pre-defined issue statuses and types and maybe resources etc. E.g. Nsd development processes as an engineering template.


Professional extensions - graphical reporting, table editors, widgets with sliders for key results and comparisons.
